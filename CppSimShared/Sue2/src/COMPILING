To compile in Windows, you must first install the complete Cygwin
package available at http://www.cygwin.com.  Be sure to follow the
directions on the Cygwin web site for proper installation, and also
make sure that you select "install" rather than "default" on the "all"
item of the Cygwin setup wizard.

Once Cygwin is installed, simply open a Bash shell, go to the
directory where this file is located, and then type at the prompt:

make -f sue_spice_netlister_makefile

Assuming Cygwin is properly installed, the above command will
create the executable sue_spice_netlister.exe.

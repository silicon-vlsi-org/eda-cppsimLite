###
**Sue2Plus** is sue2, python/Matlab/octave libs extracted from Mike Perrott's [CppSim](http://cppsim.com), a platform for mixed-signal simulation.

```

- Setting the Environment Variables in `~/.bashrc`

```bash
export CPPSIMHOME=$HOME/project2020/eda/CppSimLite
export CPPSIMSHAREDHOME=$CPPSIMHOME/CppSimShared
export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim
export PATH=$PATH:$CPPSIMSHAREDHOME/bin
```
## Sue2
- Once the environment variables are set, Sue2 can be started by typing
```bash
sue2
```
- The schematic editor will launch with an empty canvas and 3 library panels on the right.
- The first panel on the top is for `schematic` only and the bottom two for symbols or icons to use in the schematic.
- You can choose what library to appear in each panel by clicking the the menu bar in the panel. The menu will show a list of the available Libraries stored in `$CPPSIMSHAREDHOME/SueLib`(Private Libs) and `$CPPSIMHOME/SueLib`(Piblic Libs) and the list and the order is loaded from `$CPPSIMHOME/Sue2/sue.lib`
- To select a schematic, use the cursor to select the schematic (eg. *invX1*) and then click **Shift-LeftMouseButton**. **NOTE** There is bug in *sue2* in Linux-LXLE distro where LeftMouseButton doesn't work. If you are working in any other Linux (eg. ubuntu) just LeftMouseButton works.
- You can create a netlist by clicking *Tools -> Create a netlist (with top sub)* and give a directory to save (default: *$CPPSIMHOME/Netlist*) **NOTE** While saving for the option *File Type* choose *All ()* Another bug which creates two .sp extensions otherwise.
- Now you can can write a Spice testbench and include and instatiate the above created netlist. There is alrady a example testbench in *$CPPSIMHOME/SimRuns/myLib/invX1/TB_invX1.sp*
